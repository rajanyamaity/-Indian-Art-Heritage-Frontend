The oldest known archaeological fragments of paper was found in the 2nd century BCE, in China. The Persian name for paper is kagaz, which became popular in India by the 14th century. Under the Mughal rule, the paper was extensively used both in royal and administrative works, strikingly in the form of farmans or scrolls of messages. It was also during this time that paper craftsmen lived together in localities known as the ‘kagazi mohallas’.
