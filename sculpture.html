      <h1>1.The Evolution of Indian Sculpture: From Ancient Temples to Modern Art Introduction Indian sculpture, a significant aspect of India's artistic heritage, offers an extraordinary journey through history. </h1>
      <img src="image/Sculpture1.jpeg" alt="Evolution" />
      <p>Sculpture in the Indian subcontinent, partly because of the climate of the Indian subcontinent makes the long-term survival of organic materials difficult, essentially consists of sculpture of stone, metal or terracotta. It is clear there was a great deal of painting, and sculpture in wood and ivory, during these periods, but there are only a few survivals. The main Indian religions had all, after hesitant starts, developed the use of religious sculpture by around the start of the Common Era, and the use of stone was becoming increasingly widespread.

    <div class="painting">
        <h2>1.Bronze Age sculpture</h2>
        <p>The first known sculpture in the Indian subcontinent is from the Indus Valley Civilization (3300â€“1700 BCE). These include the famous small bronze Dancing Girl. However such figures in bronze and stone are rare and greatly outnumbered by pottery figurines and stone seals, often of animals or deities very finely depicted and crafted.</p>

        <h2>2.Art of the Mauryan period</h2>
        <p>The surviving art of the Mauryan Empire which ruled, at least in theory, over most of the Indian subcontinent between 322 and 185 BCE is mostly sculpture. There was an imperial court-sponsored art patronized by the emperors, especially Ashoka, and then a "popular" style produced by all others.</p>

        <h2>Art of the Shunga period</h2>
        <p>Terracotta arts executed during pre-Mauryan and Mauryan periods are further refined during Shunga periods and Chandraketugarh emerge as an important center for the terracotta arts of Shunga period. Mathura which has its basis in the pre-Mauryan period also emerges as an important center for Jain, Hindu and Buddhist art.</p>

        <h2>Satavahana art</h2>
        <p>The Satavahana dynasty ruled much of the Deccan and sometimes other areas, including Maharashtra, between about the 2nd-century BCE and 2nd century CE. They were a Hindu dynasty, who made many generous donations to Buddhist monks; some queens may have been Buddhist. The most significant remains of their sculptural patronage are the Sanchi and Amaravati Stupas,[18] along with a number of rock-cut complexes.

            Sanchi stupas were constructed by Emperor Ashoka and later expanded by Shungas and Satavahanas. Major work on decorating the site with Torana gateway and railing was done by the Satavahana Empire.</p>
