The artist draws using bare hands and the picture is first started from the center, developing outwards. Once the ‘Kalam’, which denotes the drawings or paintings made on the floor, is ready, the artist sings some ritual songs along with some instruments to worship the deity as a tradition. The ‘Kalam’ is started at a fixed time but is immediately erased once the rituals associated with it are over. Kalamezhuthu is a unique art form and the artists who practice it are

  <img src="image/Types-of-Indian-Paintings-Mysore-Style-Painting.jpg" alt="Mysore Painting" />
  <p>
    The Mysore painting has evolved in the Mysore city of Karnataka and employs thin gold leaves, similar to Tanjore Paintings. Hindu gods, deities and scenes from Hindu mythology form the most common themes of these paintings. A number of steps in the production of a Mysore painting are involved. The first phase involves the artist making an initial drawing of the picture on the base, with cartridge paper collected on a wooden basis. Afterwards, they make a paste, known as ‘gesso paste,’ of Zinc oxide and Arabic gum. The paste is utilised to produce a somewhat elevated carving appearance on those sections of the paint that require enhancements. The gold foil will then be attached to the surface. With the help of watercolours, the remaining painting is prepared. Once the paint is entirely dried, thin paper is used to cover and smoothly wiped with a soft stone. Artists employed colours of vegetables and minerals composed of diverse plant and mineral pigments and flowers. Brushes of various materials including squirrel, camel and goat’s hair were constructed and used. Grass blades have occasionally also been employed for drawing on sharp lines. Onlookers of this art style are often fascinated by its grace, beauty and complexity.

  <h1>16. Tikuli Art</h1>
  <img src="image/Types-of-Indian-Painting-Part-2-TIkuli_Art.jpg" alt="Tikuli Art" />
  <p>
    Tikuli is a rare and one-of-a-kind piece of hand painting that dates back over 800 years and originated in Patna. The Mughals lavished patronage on this form and recognised its underlying significance to a great extent. Outside of Bihar, there is no work that compares to tikuli art. It is a difficult technique that necessitates a high level of skill. Tikuli is the local term for bindis, which are essentially colourful dots worn by women as accessories between their brows. Patna and Harihans are well-known for their Tikuli speciality assembly. Tikuli’s main markets are Banaras, Patna, and Kolkata. It entails dissolving glass, blowing it into a flimsy sheet, creating and including a pattern in characteristic hues, and then decorating it with gold thwart and gems. Tikulis were primarily enhanced by Queens and Elite ladies of the past. Gems were set on gold leaves according to the status of the ladies in the general public, and these delightful high-quality Bindis were a happy possession of ladies in India.
